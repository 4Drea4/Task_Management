## Project Overview 
In this lab, I created a task management application that demonstrates dynamic list rendering, proper key usage and conditional rendering. Using Typescript I created components that handle lists of data, implemented filtering, and show different states based on task properties. This project focused on list rendering, key management, conditional rendering and component composition in React. 

## Problem 
### Problem Breakdown!/ Goal
1. Component Implementation:
→ Implement each component according to its interface requirements.
→ Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
→ Implement list rendering with unique keys.
→Add conditional rendering based on task properties.

2. List Management:

→ Render the task list with proper key props.
→ Implement filtering functionality.
→ Handle task status changes.
→ Implement task deletion.

3. Visual Feedback:

→ Show different styles based on task status and priority.
→ Implement hover and active states.
→ Add visual indicators for task properties.

4.Component Composition:

→ Compose components to create a complete task management interface.
→ Handle prop passing between components.
→ Implement proper event handling.


### Questions + Answers  

### Input
All data will be pre-inserted into the app component, however we will be able to interact with the data by filtering it, changing the status, and deleting it.

## What I did in detail 


## Troubleshooting 
   I ran into several errors as I was pulling in information from props, and unsure of what data to put where. I relied on past examples for clarity and when I could not resolve the problem on my own I resulted to asking for additional assistance.

### Problems 



1.  Mapping through a more complex problem takes thorough understanding of what you are trying to accomplish on a very detailed level. 
2. Use State is still very new, mixed with the understanding of react and now conditionals and lists making this is a very difficult project.

### Solutions


1. I continued to read through the directions, and utilized examples to pull relevant props, and created necessary functions to the best of my ability. 
2. I pulled every resource I could out of my aresenal, in depth explanations with instructors, watching numerous videos available on youtube, reading react documentation, discussing concepts with classmates, not sleeping enough, playing react in the background as I sleep hoping that the white noise seeps into my brain as I sleep.

I received very hands on assistance from a few classmates on this project. 
- Eduart with rendering in the app and composition of mapping over my task list items. <br>
- Javon with project planning, use state assistance and resources. <br>
